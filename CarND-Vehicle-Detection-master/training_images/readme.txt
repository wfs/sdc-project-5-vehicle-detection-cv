Labeled training data of /vehicles and non-vehicles used to train the Linear SVM Classifier.

To optimize your classifier, you should devise a train/test split that avoids having nearly identical images in both your training and test sets. 
This means extracting the time-series tracks from the GTI data and separating the images manually to make sure train and test images are sufficiently different from one another.
